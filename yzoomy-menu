# A setup for timing speeches while changing backgrounds for Zoom etc
# to Green, Yellow, Red, at appropriate intervals.  This shell script
# present a simple text-based menu with choices of a few speech
# lengths suitable for contests, plus names of contestants.  This menu
# depends on the shell script yzoomy for timing and image-changing.
# In operation, yzoomy requires a calibration file that can be created
# using a choice from this menu.  For use with Zoom, yzoomy also
# requires that the Zoom virtual background setup window remain
# visible (on top) in its calibrated location.

# Edit this file by substituting actual names in place of entries like
# "contestant name1" ... "contestant name5".  You can remove extra
# such entries or add more, as you like.

# Operation: Start this script by a command like ./yzoomy-menu.  Then
# select choices by entering their numbers and pressing enter.

# Example 1: To select the contestant who is named in item 9 and time
# their 5-7 minute speech: Press 9, enter to select the contestant.
# Press 3 to select the 5-7 range.  When the speaker starts, press
# enter to start timing.  Press 1, to have it ready.  When the speaker
# finishes, press enter to stop timing.  The starting and ending times
# for the speech will appear intermixed with menu prompts, and will
# also be written to a file, which can be listed out by pressing 4,
# enter.

# Example 2: To time a minute for judges to work, press 5, enter, 1.
# After the yzoomy script turns on the Red light, press enter to stop
# timing.  "Anon" start and stop times don't get listed in the times
# file.  And if you don't select a contestant name after that Anon
# time, subsequent times won't be filed either, until you do so.  You
# can select a name during a speech if you need to.  Then the elapsed
# time will be filed.

# Note, yzoomy moves the cursor out-of-menu-window each time it
# selects a new background image, and should return it back to the
# menu-window a few milliseconds later.  However, it's possible for
# interference to occur and you may sometimes need to move it back
# with the mouse.
