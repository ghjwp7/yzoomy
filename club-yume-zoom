# This script writes and runs a script, club-yume-zoom-menu, to
# display a yume menu for automatic clicking at appropriate times on
# pictures in the Zoom Virtual Background setup box.  This allows
# easier timing of speeches during virtual (online) Toastmasters
# meetings.  For technical details re yzoomy see README, plus comments
# in yzoomy.  For details re yume, see <https://github.com/ghjwp7/yume3>
